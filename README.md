descriptive statistics from my thesis dataset. My thesis examined predictors of TB diagnosis in a Mozambican Prison.

As of 2023, Mozambique faced a TB incidence rate of 361 per 100,000 people, resulting in an estimated 7,700 deaths. This figure, along with incidence of HIV-associated TB (at 27% of cases) and multidrug-resistant TB (3.7% of cases) places Mozambique in highest rates globally in all three categories that the WHO tracks. In Mozambique and all other high-burden nations, there is a dire need for better detection, diagnostics, and integrated care. Because of the nature of bacterial transmission, individuals in close proximity to one another have a higher risk of being infected with TB. This risk has been shown to be amplified in correctional facilities, like Manica Regional Prison, where overcrowding and poor ventilation are common.  As it relates to Mozambique specifically, the nation’s prisons not only report an occupancy level of over 200% but also face a lack of healthcare support which has led to even greater disparities in TB outcomes. 

The present study aims to assess the significance of potential risk factors on TB diagnosis, in the specific context of a mass screening setting at Manica Regional Prison, locally known as Penitenciária Cabeça do Velho, in Chimoio, Manica Province, Mozambique (Figure 1 above.). Each housing pavilion in this prison included ~50 rooms, with 4-5 residents living in each one.  Reaffirmation of well-known risk factors like HIV status & malnutrition as well as more variable ones like time incarcerated may help inform future TB control strategies in carceral settings.
